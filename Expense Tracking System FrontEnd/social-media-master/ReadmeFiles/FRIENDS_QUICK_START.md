## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Things to Know

1. **Blocking Removes Friendship**

   - If you block someone you're friends with, the friendship is removed first
   - You'll need to unblock AND send a new request to reconnect

2. **Unfriend is Permanent**

   - Unfriending removes all shared expense access
   - You'll need to re-add them and set up sharing again

3. **Cancel vs Reject**

   - **Cancel**: Remove YOUR outgoing request (you sent it)
   - **Reject**: Deny THEIR incoming request (they sent it)

4. **Statistics Auto-Update**

   - Stats refresh automatically when you take actions
   - No need to manually refresh

5. **Empty States**
   - Each tab shows helpful messages when empty
   - Blocked tab shows encouragement message when no one is blocked

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Review outgoing requests periodically and cancel old ones
- Use block for users who repeatedly send unwanted requests
- Check stats card regularly to stay on top of pending requests
- Unfriend before blocking if you want to give them a hint

### ❌ DON'T

- Block someone just because you don't want to be friends (use unfriend instead)
- Forget to unblock people if you blocked them by mistake
- Leave outgoing requests pending forever (cancel or follow up)
- Block/unblock repeatedly (it's confusing for the other person)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cancel button doesn't appear

**Solution**: Make sure you're in the **Outgoing** sub-tab, not Incoming

### Issue: Can't find blocked users

**Solution**: Click the **Blocked** tab (last tab with ⚠️ icon)

### Issue: Friend menu (⋮) not showing

**Solution**: Make sure you're in the **My Friends** tab, not Suggestions or Requests

### Issue: Stats showing 0 for everything

**Solution**: Click any stat card to fetch latest data from server

### Issue: Action doesn't seem to work

**Solution**: Check for toast notification at top of screen for error messages
